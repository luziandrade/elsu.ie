                                  <li>ELSU documents must not discriminate on the basis of level of English, origin,

                                    school in private and public communications. Schools may also be rated based on
                                    quantitative and qualitative research to assist students in choosing the best school

                                  <li> Members will not tolerate any form of hate speech. Members must endeavour to

                                    any group of people or individual.

                                  <li> We aim to be as multilingual as possible and to have members from various
                                    countries represent different issues and experiences as well as being able to
                                    provide support to those with lower levels of English.

                                  <li> To include as many people as possible and extend the benefits of the Union to
                                    those outside of Ireland, whether they have been students here before or planning
                                    to come to Ireland in the future.

                                  <li>To represent and fight for English Language Students’ rights in all aspects of their
                                    experience as a student, worker, their health, living conditions and wellbeing
                                    (physical, mental and emotional).
                                    </li><br>
                                  <li>To encourage student and broader societal awareness and involvement so as to
                                    help to identify and resolve any issue that might arise.
                                    </li><br>
                                  <li>To be accessible and accountable to all English language students studying or
                                    who studied in Ireland. Regardless of what jurisdiction or Country a member is in,
                                    each student's rights or issue will have just as much of a priority and support
                                    offered to them as anyone living in Dublin or any other county on the island of
                                    Ireland.
                                    </li><br>
                                  <li>That all members must be sympathetic to students affairs, this means any
                                    anti-student and anti-worker attitudes or behaviour will not be tolerated as we are
                                    constituted solely for the purpose of improving and supporting students and
                                    ensuring each student’s experience here in Ireland is a positive one.
                                    </li><br>
                                  <li>To make it clear how students can help support each other and defend
                                      themselves, as well as making their rights known in relation to school, living,
                                      accomodation and worker rights
                                  </li><br>
                                  <li>To ensure that decisions taken at meetings are agreed by a majority present and
                                    disseminated to all of those who are entitled to this information
                                  </li><br>

                                <ol>
                                  <li>The Committee</li><br>
                                  <p>
                                    ELSU members will choose a minimum 10 committee members - Maximum 20, with 5 as a
                                    quorum for committee meetings. Responsibilities of each committee member are to be
                                    defined after their election, at the AGM, or after their subsequent nomination and election.
                                    The committee must meet regularly as well as host regular meetings with the broader
                                    membership and provide regular updates for all members.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>Essential committee positions are:
                                    <ul>
                                      <li>Chair</li>
                                      <li>Secretary</li>
                                      <li>Treasurer</li>
                                      <li> Equalities Officer</li>
                                    </ul>  


                                  </p>
                                  <p>Members should not usually hold more than one of these positions. The committee must
                                    ensure that elections for the above positions are carried out fairly and democratically and in
                                    the event of a committee member stepping down, must facilitate timely by-elections. 
                                    Proper financial records must be maintained, which includes non-audited accounts returned
                                    quarterly and audited accounts returned annually; the Union should ensure that it elects
                                    auditors, usually at the same time as its committee officers.<br>
                                  </p> 
                                  <p>
                                    The entire committee must be dissolved and re-elected at each AGM. New membership,
                                    changing roles and responsibilities is to be actively encouraged but is not obligatory. The
                                    Union structure and practices must be ones in which encourage members to get involved
                                    and have their say. Representatives from each school are encouraged to regularly attend
                                    meetings. We ask that the schools and the government actively support and encourage
                                    union participation among the national student body, understanding that an ever-improving
                                    student experience is a common goal for everyone.<br>
                                  </p>   
                                  <p>
                                    Union organisation and practices must allow for membership participation, democracy and a
                                    sense of ownership of the Union. An inclusive, vibrant union life will increase participation
                                    and agency, with members having a direct influence over decision making thereby making
                                    the Union directly relevant to them. Strong membership participation in meetings, with a
                                    focus on equalities, will ensure that members are active in the community, assisting in
                                    building, as well as defending ELSU across the island of Ireland and internationally.
                                    In cases of dispute, grievance and discipline it is an aspiration of the Union that committee
                                    members take responsibility in providing representation including at appeal hearings. All
                                    members of the Union have an obligation to promote equal opportunities and tolerance
                                    inside and outside their schools and workplaces. Taking action to stamp out sexism, racism,
                                    classism, homophobia and other forms of discrimination, without putting themselves or
                                    others in needless danger.<br>
                                  </p>  
                                  <p>
                                    The Union should play a part in the broader student and labour movement locally and
                                    internationally, including affiliating with general unions such as USI, SIPTU and Unite.
