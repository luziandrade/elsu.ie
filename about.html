                           ELSU is committed to guaranteeing quality, value for money educational experiences for students of English Language Schools on the island of Ireland. ELSU will do this by working as the legitimate representative body for students in the sector, working with other stakeholders and the Irish Government.</br>

                            ELSU will form a representative body consisting of school representatives and national representatives so every student will have two representatives. This will mean that there will be a school council and an international council who will regularly meet to discuss issues and solutions.</br>

                            Students, through their elected representatives, will vote for an ELSU Executive, once these school representatives and national representatives are elected. Until an executive is elected, ELSU members insist that the teacher Fiachra Ó Luain be admitted as a full member of the Interdepartmental Working Group that is chaired by the Department of Education to represent the interests of the students during this emergency period.</br>

                            ELSU recognises the Unite ELT branch as the sole legitimate representative of English Language sector teachers and is committed to working with teachers to improve standards for both students and teachers alike.</br>
                           In addition to working to ensure excellent standards of education, ELSU will work to ensure that students have appropriate accommodation and access to services that make their experience in Ireland, or learning remotely from Irish schools worthwhile.</br>
                           ELSU will waive membership dues during the initial period of the COVID-19 emergency period, due to the dire economic situation in which many students find themselves. Anybody enrolled in an English Language School is automatically a member unless they choose to opt out of being represented by the ELSU with an email to info@elsu.ie</br></p>
